\section*{Discussion}

In this study of pre- and post-chemotherapy ovarian cancer samples, we find that neoantigen burden at relapse is frequently double that of the primary tumor. However, typically less than 5\% of the neoantigens after treatment can be attributed to chemotherapy-induced mutations using experimentally-derived signatures. In the most heavily treated patient in the cohort, chemotherapy-associated SNVs accounted for 22\% of mutations and 15\% of neoantigens. We conclude that mutagenesis from standard chemotherapy regimes in ovarian cancer contributes a minority of the neoantigen burden at relapse.

We predicted a median of 64 (50--75) expressed MHC I neoantigens across all samples in the cohort, significantly more than the median of 6 reported in another recent study of this cancer type\cite{Martin_2016}. However, Martin et al did not consider indels, MNVs, or multiple neoantigens that can result from the same missense mutation, used a 100nm instead of 500nm MHC I binding threshold, had lower quality sequencing data, and only explicitly considered HLA-A alleles. We suggest that counts of predicted MHC I binding peptides are best considered a relative indicator of tumor foreignness, not an absolute quantity readily comparable across studies.

A surprising finding was that in samples of post-chemotherapy ascitic fluid, the number of neoantigens with evidence for RNA expression tracks the increase in DNA neoantigens, but decreases in solid tumors, despite the overall increase in neoantigens in the DNA. This raises the possibility of immunoediting\cite{Dunn_2002} at the level of transcription occurring post-chemotherapy in solid tumors. This idea is consistent with studies showing that paclitaxel/carboplatin and other chemotherapies may enhance T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity in solid tumors\cite{Demaria2001,Wu_2009,Pfannenstiel_2010,Hodge_2013}, whereas ascites are intrinsically immune-suppressed\cite{Giuntoli2009,Simpson-Abelson2013,Singel2016}. However, this result is based on only four post-treatment solid tumor samples with RNA sequencing, and the analysis method is sensitive to changes in the expression of unrelated genes. Larger cohorts with paired pre- and post-chemotherapy RNA sequencing of solid tumors are needed to determine if transcriptional down-regulation of neoantigens post-treatment is a recurring phenomenon.

This study makes several technical contributions, which we hope may be a foundation for future work. We proposed a hierarchical Bayesian regression model to combine paired count data while controlling for confounding variables. We developed a method for extracting mutational signatures from treated/control mutagenicity studies, and release the nine extracted signatures with this publication. Our neoantigen identification pipeline is also made available, which includes support for indels and the identification of neoantigens with RNA support. 

There are several important limitations to this study. The neoantigens generated by indels may be over-estimated, as most frame-shifted transcripts are likely targets for nonsense mediated decay. As previously mentioned, the hard threshold on read count from RNA-seq to consider a neoantigen expressed is sensitive to changes in the expression of unrelated genes. The signature extraction used only SNVs; MNVs and indels were considered separately, and large structural rearrangements were not considered. Addressing these issue would require an extended formulation of mutational signatures, which is beyond our scope but a potentially useful direction. Finally, a substantial fraction of mutations are unaccounted by signature deconvolution, and this amount increases in the treated samples. Some of these unresolved mutations may be a result of chemotherapy-induced mutations that do not fit the animal-derived mutagenic signatures. 

% he Bayesian model controlled for the most obvious confounding variables (tumor sample type, purity, and the number of samples from the same donor) but there are potentially other sources of bias to mutation calling, such as variations in read coverage over the genome and the clonal structure of the tumor.

% Large genomic rearrangements were also not considered, and are known to result in neoantigens \cite{Worley2001}.
