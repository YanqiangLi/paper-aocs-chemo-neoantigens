@article{Simpson-Abelson2013,
  abstract = {Human memory T cells present in ovarian tumor ascites fluids fail to respond normally to stimulation via the T cell receptor (TCR). This immunosuppression is manifested by decreases in NF-$\kappa$B and NFAT activation, IFN-$\gamma$ production, and cell proliferation in response to TCR stimulation with immobilized antibodies to CD3 and CD28. The anergy of the tumor-associated T cells (TATs) is mediated by soluble factors present in ovarian tumor ascites fluids. The non-responsiveness of the T cells is quickly reversed when the cells are assayed in the absence of the ascites fluid, and is rapidly reestablished when a cell-free ascites fluid is added back to the T cells. Based upon the observed normal phosphorylation patterns of the TCR proximal signaling molecules, the inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B, and NFAT activation in response to TCR stimulation, as well as the ability of the diacylglycerol analog PMA and the ionophore ionomycin to bypass the ascites fluid-induced TCR signaling arrest, the site of the arrest in the activation cascade appears to be at or just upstream of PLC-$\gamma$. An identical TCR signaling arrest pattern was observed when T cells derived from normal donor peripheral blood were incubated with either malignant or nonmalignant (cirrhotic) ascites fluids. The immunosuppressive activity of ascites fluids reported here suggests that soluble factors acting directly or indirectly upon T cells present within tumors contribute to the anergy that has previously been observed in T cells derived from malignant and nonmalignant inflammatory microenvironments. The soluble immunosuppressive factors represent potential therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer.},

@article{Giuntoli2009,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND To identify immunosuppressive elements present in ovarian cancer associated ascites. PATIENTS AND METHODS Ascites and plasma were obtained from ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer patients. Surface markers were identified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured with LINCOplex microarrays. Antigen-specific T-lymphocytes from ascites and plasma were expanded with artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC). Cell-mediated immune response was assessed with chromium release assays. RESULTS Samples were collected from 37 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. FACS was performed on 27 ascites specimens. A low CD4/CD8 ratio ({\textless}1.6) was seen in 13 patient samples and associated with significantly improved overall survival (p=0.040). LINCOplex evaluation of 22 paired ascites and plasma samples demonstrated significantly elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1beta and VEGF and significantly reduced levels of IL-2, IL-5, IL-7, IL-17, PDGF-BB, and RANTES in ascites compared to plasma (p{\textless}0.05). Autologous ovarian cancer cell lysis with T-lymphocytes from ascites was limited. Although aAPC stimulation resulted in effective expansion of antigen specific T-cells from peripheral lymphocytes (35-fold), only limited expansion was noted from ascites-derived lymphocytes (10-fold). CONCLUSION Ovarian cancer-associated ascites may provide an immunosuppressive environment. A high CD4/CD8 ratio, which may indicate the presence of regulatory T-cells, is associated with poor outcome. Reduced IL-2 and elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels favor a Th2 inhibitory immune response. This immunosuppressive climate may explain our observation of non responsiveness in ascites derived T-cells.},
