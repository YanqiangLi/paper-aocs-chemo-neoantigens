High neoantigen burden is associated with response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. We investigated computationally-predicted potential neoantigens (mutated MHC I binding peptides) for 12 donors from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study with whole genome sequencing of chemotherapy-naive primary tumors and matched post-treatment relapse samples. All patients received combination paclitaxel/carboplatin in addition to other therapies. We find that chemo-treated relapse samples have more potential neoantigens than the matched primary tumors. The unique-to-relapse mutations are present at similar allelic fractions in the relapse samples as the shared mutations; they are not especially subclonal. Mutational signature deconvolution did not consistently attribute the new mutations to a known signature not already operative in the primary samples. In particular, the mutations were not attributed to a signature associated with cisplatin exposure in \textit{C. Elegans}.

% These results suggest that the increase in neoantigen burden is increased in recurrent Ovarian cancer over primary samples but that this increase is due to a mix of intrinsic processes as opposed to direct mutagenic impact of the platinum chemotherapy.
