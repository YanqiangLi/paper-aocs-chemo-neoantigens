\subsection*{Mutational signature deconvolution}
Signatures were deconvolved using the deconstructSigs\cite{Rosenthal_2016} package using the 30 signatures curated by COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures) plus a signature we manually extracted from a study of cisplatin exposure in \textit{C. Elegans}\cite{Meier_2014}. The manual extraction of this signature was done by counting the number of occurrences of each of the 96 possible mutations in trinucleotide contexts in the normal genomic background (Genotype=”N2”) and treated by Cisplatin at any concentration and normalizing by the trinucleotide content of the \texit{C. Elegans} genome. We did not consider mutations introduced in Cisplatin-treated individuals of other genomic backgrounds.
