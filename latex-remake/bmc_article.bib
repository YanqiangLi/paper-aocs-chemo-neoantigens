@article{Simpson-Abelson2013,
  abstract = {Human memory T cells present in ovarian tumor ascites fluids fail to respond normally to stimulation via the T cell receptor (TCR). This immunosuppression is manifested by decreases in NF-$\kappa$B and NFAT activation, IFN-$\gamma$ production, and cell proliferation in response to TCR stimulation with immobilized antibodies to CD3 and CD28. The anergy of the tumor-associated T cells (TATs) is mediated by soluble factors present in ovarian tumor ascites fluids. The non-responsiveness of the T cells is quickly reversed when the cells are assayed in the absence of the ascites fluid, and is rapidly reestablished when a cell-free ascites fluid is added back to the T cells. Based upon the observed normal phosphorylation patterns of the TCR proximal signaling molecules, the inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B, and NFAT activation in response to TCR stimulation, as well as the ability of the diacylglycerol analog PMA and the ionophore ionomycin to bypass the ascites fluid-induced TCR signaling arrest, the site of the arrest in the activation cascade appears to be at or just upstream of PLC-$\gamma$. An identical TCR signaling arrest pattern was observed when T cells derived from normal donor peripheral blood were incubated with either malignant or nonmalignant (cirrhotic) ascites fluids. The immunosuppressive activity of ascites fluids reported here suggests that soluble factors acting directly or indirectly upon T cells present within tumors contribute to the anergy that has previously been observed in T cells derived from malignant and nonmalignant inflammatory microenvironments. The soluble immunosuppressive factors represent potential therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer.},

@article{Giuntoli2009,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND To identify immunosuppressive elements present in ovarian cancer associated ascites. PATIENTS AND METHODS Ascites and plasma were obtained from ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer patients. Surface markers were identified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cytokine and chemokine concentrations were measured with LINCOplex microarrays. Antigen-specific T-lymphocytes from ascites and plasma were expanded with artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC). Cell-mediated immune response was assessed with chromium release assays. RESULTS Samples were collected from 37 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. FACS was performed on 27 ascites specimens. A low CD4/CD8 ratio ({\textless}1.6) was seen in 13 patient samples and associated with significantly improved overall survival (p=0.040). LINCOplex evaluation of 22 paired ascites and plasma samples demonstrated significantly elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1beta and VEGF and significantly reduced levels of IL-2, IL-5, IL-7, IL-17, PDGF-BB, and RANTES in ascites compared to plasma (p{\textless}0.05). Autologous ovarian cancer cell lysis with T-lymphocytes from ascites was limited. Although aAPC stimulation resulted in effective expansion of antigen specific T-cells from peripheral lymphocytes (35-fold), only limited expansion was noted from ascites-derived lymphocytes (10-fold). CONCLUSION Ovarian cancer-associated ascites may provide an immunosuppressive environment. A high CD4/CD8 ratio, which may indicate the presence of regulatory T-cells, is associated with poor outcome. Reduced IL-2 and elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels favor a Th2 inhibitory immune response. This immunosuppressive climate may explain our observation of non responsiveness in ascites derived T-cells.},

@article{Worley2001,
  abstract = {Synovial sarcoma (SS), clear cell sarcoma (CCS), and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) are soft-tissue malignancies occurring primarily in adolescents and young adults. These tumors contain specific chromosomal translocations that fuse the 5' region of one gene with the 3' region of another, resulting in the formation of characteristic fusion proteins. These translocations are unique to tumor cells and may be required for persistence, thereby serving as targets for immunotherapy. It was hypothesized that the fusion breakpoint sequences associated with SS, CCS, and DSRCT can serve as tumor-specific neoantigens. To test this, peptides corresponding to the fusion breakpoints were designed and assessed for ability to bind to various class I HLA molecules. Two peptides derived from the SS breakpoint specifically bind the HLA-B7 antigen, and a 10-amino acid minimal epitope was identified for this interaction. Specific binding of a SS peptide and a CCS peptide to HLA-B27 molecule was also observed. Finally, a peptide designed from the DSRCT breakpoint specifically binds the HLA-A3 molecule, and a 9-amino acid optimal epitope was identified for this interaction. The physiological/immunological relevance of these peptide/MHC interactions was demonstrated by the induction of SS-specific CTLs from normal donor lymphocytes using in vitro stimulation with autologous, peptide-pulsed dendritic cells and by the ability of these CTLs to lyse human SS tumor cells endogenously expressing the full-length fusion protein. These results suggest that sequences in the fusion region of sarcoma-associated chimeras can bind class I HLA molecules and serve as neoantigens. These may be useful for the development of novel immunotherapies for sarcoma patients with appropriate HLA molecules and tumors bearing these translocations.},

@article{Sette1994,
  abstract = {The relationship between binding affinity for HLA class I molecules and immunogenicity of discrete peptide epitopes has been analyzed in two different experimental approaches. In the first approach, the immunogenicity of potential epitopes ranging in MHC binding affinity over a 10,000-fold range was analyzed in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. In the second approach, the antigenicity of approximately 100 different hepatitis B virus (HBV)-derived potential epitopes, all carrying A*0201 binding motifs, was assessed by using PBL of acute hepatitis patients. In both cases, it was found that an affinity threshold of approximately 500 nM (preferably 50 nM or less) apparently determines the capacity of a peptide epitope to elicit a CTL response. These data correlate well with class I binding affinity measurements of either naturally processed peptides or previously described T cell epitopes. Taken together, these data have important implications for the selection of epitopes for peptide-based vaccines, and also formally demonstrate the crucial role of determinant selection in the shaping of T cell responses. Because in most (but not all) cases, high affinity peptides seem to be immunogenic, our data also suggest that holes in the functional T cell repertoire, if they exist, may be relatively rare.},

@article{Hodge2013,
  abstract = {Certain chemotherapeutic regimens trigger cancer cell death while inducing dendritic cell maturation and subsequent immune responses. However, chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) has thus far been restricted to select agents. In contrast, several chemotherapeutic drugs modulate antitumor immune responses, despite not inducing classic ICD. In addition, in many cases tumor cells do not die after treatment. Here, using docetaxel, one of the most widely used cancer chemotherapeutic agents, as a model, we examined phenotypic and functional consequences of tumor cells that do not die from ICD. Docetaxel treatment of tumor cells did not induce ATP or high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) secretion, or cell death. However, calreticulin (CRT) exposure was observed in all cell lines examined after chemotherapy treatment. Killing by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), MUC-1, or PSA-specific CD8(+) CTLs was significantly enhanced after docetaxel treatment. This killing was associated with increases in components of antigen-processing machinery, and mediated largely by CRT membrane translocation, as determined by functional knockdown of CRT, PERK, or CRT-blocking peptide. A docetaxel-resistant cell line was selected (MDR-1(+), CD133(+)) by continuous exposure to docetaxel. These cells, while resistant to direct cytostatic effects of docetaxel, were not resistant to the chemomodulatory effects that resulted in enhancement of CTL killing. Here, we provide an operational definition of immunogenic modulation, where exposure of tumor cells to nonlethal/sublethal doses of chemotherapy alters tumor phenotype to render the tumor more sensitive to CTL killing. These observations are distinct and complementary to ICD and highlight a mechanism whereby chemotherapy can be used in combination with immunotherapy.},

@article{Alexandrov2013,
  abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

abstract = {The ligands for programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), an immunoinhibitory receptor belonging to CD28/cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 family, are PD-1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-Ls). Recent reports suggest that the aberrant expression of PD-Ls on tumor cells impairs antitumor immunity, resulting in the immune evasion of the tumor cells. Although an inverse correlation between the expression level of PD-Ls and patients' prognosis has been reported for several malignant tumors, the follow-up period was limited because of the lack of the antibody (Ab) applicable to paraffin-embedded specimens. Here we generated a new Ab against PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and analyzed the expression level of PD-Ls in human ovarian cancer using paraffin-embedded specimens. Patients with higher expression of PD-L1 had a significantly poorer prognosis than patients with lower expression. Although patients with higher expression of PD-1 ligand 2 also had a poorer prognosis, the difference was not statistically significant. A significant inverse correlation was observed between PD-L1 expression and the intraepithelial CD8(+) T lymphocyte count, suggesting that PD-L1 on tumor cells directly suppresses antitumor CD8(+) T cells. Multivariate analysis showed the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and intraepithelial CD8(+) T lymphocyte count are independent prognostic factors. The PD-1/PD-L pathway can be a good target for restoring antitumor immunity in ovarian cancer.},

@article{Sato2005,
abstract = {In a recent report, [Zhang et al. (2003) N. Engl. J. Med. 348, 203-213], the presence of CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was found to correlate with improved survival in epithelial ovarian cancer. We performed immunohistochemical analysis for TILs and cancer testis antigens in 117 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer. The interrelationship between subpopulations of TILs and expression of cancer testis antigens was investigated, as well as between TILs and overall survival. The median follow-up of the patients was 31 months. Patients with higher frequencies of intraepithelial CD8+ T cells demonstrated improved survival compared with patients with lower frequencies [median = 55 versus 26 months; hazard ratio = 0.33; confidence interval (C.I.) = 0.18-0.60; P = 0.0003]. No association was found for CD3+ TILs or other subtypes of intraepithelial or stromal TILs. However, the subgroups with high versus low intraepithelial CD8+/CD4+ TIL ratios had median survival of 74 and 25 months, respectively (hazard ratio = 0.30; C.I. = 0.16-0.55; P = 0.0001). These results indicate that CD4+ TILs influence the beneficial effects of CD8+ TIL. This unfavorable effect of CD4+ T cells on prognosis was found to be due to CD25+ forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T cells (Treg; suppressor T cells), as indicated by survival of patients with high versus low CD8+/Treg ratios (median = 58 versus 23 months; hazard ratio = 0.31; C.I. = 0.17-0.58; P = 0.0002). The favorable prognostic effect of intraepithelial CD8+ TILs did not correlate with concurrent expression of NY-ESO-1 or MAGE antigens. We conclude that intraepithelial CD8+ TILs and a high CD8+/Treg ratio are associated with favorable prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer.},

abstract = {Large-scale genomic characterization of tumors from prospective cohort studies may yield new insights into cancer pathogenesis. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 619 incident colorectal cancers (CRCs) and integrated the results with tumor immunity, pathology, and survival data. We identified recurrently mutated genes in CRC, such as BCL9L, RBM10, CTCF, and KLF5, that were not previously appreciated in this disease. Furthermore, we investigated the genomic correlates of immune-cell infiltration and found that higher neoantigen load was positively associated with overall lymphocytic infiltration, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), memory T cells, and CRC-specific survival. The association with TILs was evident even within microsatellite-stable tumors. We also found positive selection of mutations in HLA genes and other components of the antigen-processing machinery in TIL-rich tumors. These results may inform immunotherapeutic approaches in CRC. More generally, this study demonstrates a framework for future integrative molecular epidemiology research in colorectal and other malignancies.},

@article{Yu2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer to affect women in the world. Studies showed tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes can exhibit both beneficial and harmful effects on the biology and clinical outcome of breast cancer, the conclusion still remains incomplete. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and breast cancer. METHODS A comprehensive search strategy was used to search relevant literatures in PubMed and the ISI Web of Science. The correlation among TILs and breast cancer clinicopathological features and prognosis was analyzed by using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 12.0. RESULT Seventeen eligible studies consisting of 12,968 participants were included. We found that higher value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had no relationship with breast cancer clinicopathological variables. Interestingly, it was correlated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in majority (pooled RR 2.43, 95{\%} CI 1.99-2.97). Moreover, higher value of total tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (both intraepithelial and stromal) was associated with better prognosis (pooled HR 0.88, 95{\%} CI 0.83-0.94), whereas some subtypes predicted a worse prognosis. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis indicated that high value of total TILs is not associated with breast cancer clinicopathological features, but can predict a favorable outcome for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in majority except for hormone receptor (-) subtype. And higher total TILs (both intraepithelial TILs and stromal TILs) may be the potential better prognostic indicators, while some subtypes like PD-1(+) TILs and Foxp3(+) TILs show a worse prognosis.},

@article{Drerup2015,
abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT All work referenced herein relates to treatment of epithelial ovarian carcinomas, as their treatment differs from ovarian germ cell cancers and other rare ovarian cancers, the treatments of which are addressed elsewhere. Fallopian tube cancers and primary peritoneal adenocarcinomatosis are also generally treated as epithelial ovarian cancers. The standard of care initial treatment of advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer is optimal debulking surgery as feasible plus chemotherapy with a platinum plus a taxane agent. If this front-line approach fails, as it too often the case, several FDA-approved agents are available for salvage therapy. However, because no second-line therapy for advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer is typically curative, we prefer referral to clinical trials as logistically feasible, even if it means referring patients outside our system. Immune therapy has a sound theoretical basis for treating carcinomas generally, and for treating ovarian cancer in particular. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenic basis of ovarian cancer, and the immunopathologic basis for prior failures of immunotherapy for it and other carcinomas promises to afford novel treatment approaches with potential for significant efficacy, and reduced toxicities compared with cytotoxic agents. Thus, referral to early phase immunotherapy trials for ovarian cancer patients that fail conventional treatment merits consideration.},
