\parttitle{Background}
Patients with highly mutated tumors, such as melanoma or smoking-related lung cancer, have higher rates of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, perhaps due to increased neoantigen expression. Many chemotherapies including platinum compounds are known to be mutagenic, but the impact of standard treatment protocols on mutational burden and resulting neoantigen expression in most human cancers is unknown.

\parttitle{Methods}
We sought to quantify the effect of chemotherapy treatment on computationally predicted neoantigen expression for high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) patients enrolled in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. In this series,  35 of 114 samples were collected after exposure to chemotherapy, and 14 are matched with an untreated sample from the same patient. Our approach integrates whole genome and RNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples with class I MHC binding prediction and mutational signatures extracted from studies of chemotherapy-exposed \textit{C. Elegans} and \textit{G. Gallus} cells. We additionally investigated relationships among neoantigens, tumor infiltrating immune cells estimated from RNA-seq with CIBERSORT, and patient survival.

%We sought to quantify the effect of chemotherapy treatment on computationally predicted neoantigen expression for 12 high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) patients with pre- and post-chemotherapy samples collected in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. We additionally analyzed 16 patients from the cohort with post-treatment samples only, including five primary surgical samples exposed to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our approach integrates tumor whole genome and RNA sequencing with class I MHC binding prediction and mutational signatures of chemotherapy exposure extracted from preclinical studies of chemotherapy-exposed \textit{C. Elegans} and \textit{G. Gallus} cells.

\parttitle{Results}
Neoantigen burden and CD8+ T cell infiltration in primary, pre-treatment samples were independent predictors of survival. Relapse samples collected after chemotherapy harbored a median of 78\% more expressed neoantigens than untreated primary samples, a figure that combines the effects of chemotherapy and other processes operative during relapse. The contribution from chemotherapy-associated signatures was small, accounting for a mean of 5\% (range 0--16) of the expressed neoantigen burden in relapse samples. In both treated and untreated samples, most neoantigens were attributed to COSMIC \textit{Signature (3)}, associated with BRCA disruption, \textit{Signature (1)}, associated with a slow mutagenic process active in healthy tissue, and \textit{Signature (8)}, of unknown etiology.

\section*{Background}

Many chemotherapies including platinum compounds~\cite{Hannan_1989}, cyclophosphamide~\cite{Anderson_1995}, and etoposide~\cite{NAKANOMYO_1986} exert their effect through DNA damage, and recent studies have found evidence for chemotherapy-induced mutations in post-treatment acute myeloid leukaemia~\cite{Ding_2012}, glioma~\cite{Johnson_2013}, and esophageal adenocarcinoma~\cite{Murugaesu_2015}. Successful development of immune checkpoint-mediated therapy\cite{Chen_2013} has focused attention on the importance of T cell responses to somatic mutations in coding genes that generate neoantigens~\cite{Schumacher_2015}. Patients with increased tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells have better prognosis~\cite{Sato2005,Hamanishi2007}, and studies based on bulk-sequencing of tumor samples followed by computational peptide-class I MHC affinity prediction~\cite{Lundegaard_2007} have associated increased mutations and resulting mutant MHC I peptide ligands with improved survival~\cite{Brown_2014}, especially in the context of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy~\cite{Van_Allen_2015,Rizvi_2015}. Ovarian cancers fall into an intermediate group of solid tumors in terms of mutational load present in pre-treatment surgical samples\cite{Lawrence_2013}. However, the effect of standard chemotherapy regimes on tumor mutation burden and resulting neoantigen expression in ovarian cancer is poorly understood.

Investigators associated with the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS) performed whole genome and RNA sequencing of 79 pre-treatment and 35 post-treatment cancer samples from 92 HGSC patients, including 12 patients with both pre- and post-treatment samples~\cite{Patch_2015}. The samples were obtained from solid tissue resections, autopsies, and ascites drained to relieve abdominal distension. Treatment regimes varied but primary treatment always included platinum-based chemotherapy. In their analysis, Patch et al. reported that post-treatment samples harbored more somatic mutations than pre-treatment samples and exhibited evidence of chemotherapy-associated mutations. Here we extend these results by quantifying the mutations and predicted neoantigens attributable to chemotherapy-associated mutational signatures. We also probe associations between predicted neoantigen burden, immune cell infiltration estimated from RNA-seq, and patient survival. We find that neoantigen burden and CD8+ T cell infiltration are independently associated with survival, and that, while neoantigen expression increases after treatment and relapse, only a small part of the increase is due to mutations associated with chemotherapy signatures. 

% It was interesting to observe that neoantigen burden in the primary/untreated samples was a stronger predictor of patient survival than overall mutaiton burden, and that neoantigen burden and CD8+ T cell infiltrate estimated by CIBERSORT were both independent predictors of survival. Several studies have reported the importance of CD8+ T cell infiltrate as a prognostic marker in HGSC~\cite{Sato2005,Hamanishi2007}; the role of neoantigens over total mutation burden has been reported in the context of immunotherapy~\cite{Van_Allen_2015,Rizvi_2015} and for patients treated with conventional chemotherapies as in our case~\cite{Brown_2014}. Studies of larger cohorts have reported relationships between neoantigen burden and markers of T cell infiltration~\cite{Rooney_2015,Giannakis2016}; the absence of a correlation in our data may be due to our smaller cohort.

\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{Clinical sample information}
We grouped the AOCS samples into three sets --- ``primary/untreated,'' ``primary/treated,'' and ``relapse/treated'' --- according to collection time point and chemotherapy exposure (Table~\ref{tab:samples}). The primary/untreated group consists of 75 primary debulking surgical samples and 4 samples of drained ascites. The primary/treated group consists of 5 primary debulking surgical samples obtained from patients pretreated with chemotherapy prior to surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy). The relapse/treated group consists of 24 relapse or recurrence ascites samples, 5 metastatic samples obtained in autopsies of two patients, and 1 solid tissue relapse surgical sample, all of which were obtained after prior exposure to one or more lines of chemotherapy.  In summary, these groupings yield 79 primary/untreated samples, 5 primary/treated samples, and 30 relapse/treated samples. Specimen and clinical information for each sample is listed in Additional File 1.

Independent of treatment, ascites samples trend toward more detected mutations, perhaps due to increased intermixing of clones. We therefore stratified by tissue type (solid tumor or ascites) when comparing the mutation and neoantigen burdens of pre- and post-treatment samples. As some patients provided multiple samples of the same type, we reweighted the samples so each patient contributes equally in these comparisons.

\subsection*{Mutation calls}
We analyzed the mutation calls published by Patch et al.~\cite{Patch_2015} (Additional File 2). DNA and RNA sequencing reads were downloaded from the European Genome-phenome Archive under accession EGAD00001000877. Adjacent single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from the same patient were combined to form multinucleotide variants (MNVs). 

We considered a mutation to be present in a sample if it was called for the patient and more than 5 percent of the overlapping reads and at least 6 reads total supported the alternate allele. We considered a mutation to be expressed if there were 3 or more RNA reads supporting the alternate allele. In the analysis of paired pre- and post-treatment samples from the same donors, we defined a mutation as unique to the post-treatment sample if the pre-treatment sample contained greater than 30 reads coverage and no variant reads at the site.

\subsection*{Variant annotation, HLA typing, and MHC binding prediction}
\begin{sloppypar}
Protein coding effects were predicted using Varcode (manuscript in preparation, https://github.com/hammerlab/varcode). All transcripts overlapping each mutation were considered, and the transcript with the most disruptive effect was selected using a prioritization similar to other tools (from highest priority: frameshift, loss of stop codon, insertion or deletion, substitution). In the case of frameshift mutations, all downstream peptides generated up to a stop codon were considered potential neoantigens.

HLA typing was performed using a consensus of seq2HLA~\cite{Boegel_2012} and OptiType ~\cite{Szolek_2014} across the samples for each patient (Additional File 3).

Class I MHC binding predictions were performed for peptides of length 8--11 using NetMHCpan 2.8~\cite{Lundegaard_2008} with default arguments (predicted neoantigens are listed in Additional File 2).
\end{sloppypar}

\subsection*{Mutational signatures}
The use of mutational signatures is necessary because it is not possible to distinguish chemotherapy-induced mutations from temporal effects when comparing primary and relapse samples by mutation count alone. A mutational signature ascribes a probability to each of the 96 possible single-nucleotide variants, where a variant is defined by its reference base pair, alternate base pair, and base pairs immediately adjacent to the mutation. Signatures have been associated with exposure to particular mutagens, age related DNA changes, and disruption of DNA damage repair pathways due to somatic mutations or germline risk variants in melanoma, breast, lung and other cancers~\cite{Alexandrov2013}, and provide a means of identifying the contribution that chemotherapy may make to the mutations seen in post-treatment samples. For example, the chemotherapy temozolomide has been shown to induce mutations consisting predominantly of $C \rightarrow T$ (equivalently, $G \rightarrow A$) transitions at CpC and CpT dinucleotides~\cite{Johnson_2013}. To perform deconvolution, the SNVs observed in a sample are tabulated by trinucleotide context, and a combination of signatures, each corresponding to a mutagenic process, is found that best explains the observed counts. Mutational signatures may be discovered \textit{de novo} from large cancer sequencing projects but for smaller studies it is preferable to deconvolve using known signatures~\cite{Rosenthal_2016}.

The Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) Signature Resource curates 30 signatures discovered in a pan-cancer analysis of untreated primary tissue samples. While signatures for exposure to the carboplatin/paclitaxel combination that is standard first line therapy in ovarian cancer have not been established, two recent reports provide data on mutations detected in cisplatin-exposed \textit{C. Elegans}~\cite{Meier_2014} and a \textit{G. Gallus} cell line exposed to several chemotherapies including cisplatin, chyclophosphamide, and etoposide ~\cite{Szikriszt_2016}. As cisplatin is thought to induce the same DNA adducts as carboplatin, we reasoned that the mutational signatures of these related compounds are likely similar~\cite{Atsushi19941009}. In the AOCS cohort, 28 patients with post-treatment samples were treated with carboplatin, four with cisplatin, eight with cyclophosphamide, and one with etoposide.

From the SNVs identified in the animal models, we defined two signatures for cisplatin, a signature for cyclophosphamide, and a signature for etoposide (Figures~S1 and~S2). As both studies sequenced replicates of chemotherapy-treated and untreated (control) samples, identifying a mutational signature associated with treatment required splitting the mutations observed in the treated group into background and treatment effects. We did this using a Bayesian model for each study and chemotherapy drug separately.

Let $C_{i,j}$ be the number of mutations observed in experiment $i$ for mutational trinucletoide context $0 \leq j < 96$. Let $t_i \in \{0,1\}$ be 1 if the treatment was administered in experiment $i$ and 0 if it was a control. We estimate the number of mutations in each context arising due to background (non-treatment) processes $B_j$ and the number due to treatment $T_j$ according to the model:

\[
C_{i,j} \sim \mathit{Poisson}(B_j + t_i T_j)
\]

We fit this model using Stan~\cite{Gelman_2015} with a uniform (improper) prior on the entries of $B$ and $T$. The treatment-associated mutational signature $N$ was calculated from a point estimate of $T$ as:

\[
N_j = \left ( \frac{T_j}{\sum_{j'}{T_{j'}}} \right ) \left ( \frac{h_j}{m_j} \right )
\]

where $h_j$ and $m_j$ are the number of times the reference trinucleotide $j$ occurs in the human and preclinical model (\textit{C. Elegans} or \textit{G. Gallus}) genomes, respectively.

%The signature deconvolution was performed with the deconstructSigs\cite{Rosenthal_2016} package using the following parameters passed to \texttt{whichSignatures()}:

Signature deconvolution was performed with the deconstructSigs\cite{Rosenthal_2016} package using the 30 mutational signatures curated by COSMIC~\cite{364242} extended to include the putative chemotherapy-associated signatures (Additional Files 4 and 5). When establishing whether a signature was ``detected'' in a sample, we applied the 6\% of SNVs cutoff recommended by the authors of the deconstructSigs package. Signatures assigned weights less than this threshold in a sample were considered undetected.

%\texttt{contexts.needed=TRUE}, \texttt{signature.cutoff=0.0}, \texttt{tri.counts.method="default"}

To estimate the number of SNVs and neoantigens generated by a signature, for each mutation in the sample we calculated the posterior probability that the signature generated the mutation, as described below. The sum of these probabilities gives the expected number of SNVs attributable to each signature. For neoantigens, we weighted the terms of this sum by the number of neoantigens generated by each mutation.

Suppose a mutation occurs in context $j$ and sample $i$. We calculate $\Pr[s \mid j]$, the probability that signature $s$ gave rise to this mutation, using Bayes' rule:

\[
\Pr[s \mid j] = \frac{\Pr[j \mid s] \Pr[s]}{\sum_{s'}{\Pr[j \mid s']\Pr[s']}} = \frac{H_{s,j} \, D_{i,s}}{\sum_{s'}{H_{s',j} \, D_{i,s'}}}
\]

where $D_{i,s}$ is the result matrix from deconstructSigs, giving the contribution of signature $s$ to sample $i$, and $H_{s,j}$ is the weight for signature $s$ on mutational context $j$. For each chemotherapy-associated signature, $H_{s,j}$ is given by $N_j$ above. For the other signatures it is defined in the COSMIC Signature Resource.

For treated samples with a pre-treatment sample available from the same patient, we deconvolved signatures for both the full set of mutations and for the mutations detected only after treatment. When calculating $\Pr[s \mid j]$ for these samples, for each mutation we selected the appropriate deconvolution matrix $D_{i,s}$ based on whether the mutation was unique to the post-treatment sample.

\subsection*{Survival analysis}
Survival analyses were performed with the Cox proportional hazards model from the lifelines Python package version 0.9.3.2~\cite{cameron2017}. Analyses were stratified by tumor stage (III or IV) and included the logarithm of the tumor cellularity percentage as a covariate. Key findings were reproduced with the survival R package~\cite{survivalpackage}.

\subsection*{Immune deconvolution}
RNA-seq reads were aligned using STAR version 2.4.1d~\cite{dobin2013}, transcript quantifications were obtained with Cufflinks version 2.2.1~\cite{trapnell2010}, and immune deconvolution was performed by CIBERSORT version 1.01~\cite{newman2015}. 


\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Cisplatin and cyclophosphamide mutational signatures correlate with clinical treatment}

We identified mutational signatures for cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide from the \textit{G. Gallus} cell line data (Figure~S1), as well as a second cisplatin signature from experiments in \textit{C. Elegans} (Figure~S2). The two cisplatin signatures were not identical. Both signatures placed most probability mass on $C \rightarrow A$ mutations, but differed in preference for the nucleotides adjacent to the mutation. The \textit{G. Gallus} signature was relatively indifferent to the 5' base and favored a 3' cytosine, whereas the \textit{C. Elegans} signature was specific for a 5' cytosine and a 3' pyrmidine. The \textit{G. Gallus} cisplatin signature was closest in cosine distance to COSMIC \textit{Signature (24) Aflatoxin}, \textit{Signature (4) Smoking}, and \textit{Signature (29) Chewing tobacco}, all associated with guanine adducts. The \textit{C. Elegans} cisplatin signature was similar to \textit{Signature (4) Smoking}, \textit{Signature (20) Mismatch repair}, and \textit{Signature (14) Unknown}. The \textit{G. Gallus} cyclophosphamide signature favored $T \rightarrow A$ and $C \rightarrow T$ mutations and was most similar to COSMIC Signatures \textit{(25)}, \textit{(8)}, and \textit{(5)}, all of unknown etiology. The \textit{G. Gallus} etoposide signature distributed probability mass nearly uniformly across mutation contexts and was most similar to COSMIC \textit{Signature (5) Unknown}, \textit{Signature (3) BRCA}, and \textit{Signature (16) Unknown}. Overall, the chemotherapy signatures were no closer to any COSMIC signatures than the two most similar COSMIC signatures (\textit{Signature (12) Unknown} and \textit{Signature (26) Mismatch repair}) are to each other, suggesting that deconvolution could in principle distinguish their contributions.

We performed signature deconvolution on each sample's SNVs (top and middle of Figures~S3 and~S4). Detection of the cyclophosphamide signature at the 6\% threshold was associated with clinical cyclophosphamide treatment (Bonferroni-corrected Fischer's exact test $p = 0.004$), occurring in 4/10 samples taken after cyclophosphamide treatment, 2/79 pre-treatment samples, and 2/25 samples exposed to chemotherapies other than cyclophosphamide. In contrast, the two cisplatin signatures were found in no samples, and the etoposide signature was found only in four pre-treatment samples.

For better sensitivity, we next focused on the 14 relapse/treated samples from the 12 patients with both pre- and post-treatment samples. For each patient, we extracted the mutations that had evidence exclusively in the treated samples. Of 206,766 SNVs in the post-treatment samples for these patients, 93,986 (45\%) satisfied our filter and were subjected to signature deconvolution (Figure~1, bottom of Figures~S3 and~S4). Within this subgroup, the \textit{G. gallus} cisplatin signature was identified only in the two samples taken after cisplatin therapy, a significant association ($p = 0.04$). The \textit{C. Elegans} cisplatin signature was detected in no samples, and the cyclophosphamide signature was detected in 3/6 cyclophosphamide-treated samples, but, unexpectedly, also in 6/8 non-cyclophosphamide-treated samples. These included the two post-treatment samples in which the signature was detected in the earlier analysis plus four additional samples. COSMIC \textit{Signature (3) BRCA} and \textit{Signature (8) Unknown etiology} were detected in 14/14 and 9/14 post-treatment samples, respectively, but \textit{Signature (1) Age} was absent, consistent with its association with a slow mutagenic process operative before oncogenesis.

Considering all relapse/treated samples, the \textit{G. Gallus} cisplatin signature showed a dose-dependent relationship with the total number of cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy cycles administered (Pearson correlation $r=0.47$; Figure S5). In a linear regression, each additional cycle of platinum was associated with 9.0 (95\% CI 3.6--14.3) more genome-wide mutations attributed to this signature, giving rise to 0.08 (-0.01--0.17) additional neoantigens per cycle. A weaker trend was observed among patients whose only platinum exposure was carboplatin ($r=0.24$; 3.7 (-1.6--9.0) mutations per cycle). The cyclophosphamide signature had little association with the number of cycles of cyclophosphamide ($r=0.11$; 30.4 (-58.9--120.0) mutations per cycle). The time elapsed between the most recent chemotherapy cycle and sample collection did not independently correlate with total mutations or mutations attributed to chemotherapy signatures in a linear model that included the total number of cycles ($p > 0.15$ for all tests).

% Power to detect a dose dependency in this case is expected to be lower due to the fewer cycles of cyclophosphamide administered compared to platinum (maximum of 6 for any patient vs. 40).

In summary, the mutational signatures for cisplatin and cyclophosphamide extracted from experiments of a \textit{G. Gallus} cell line showed significant but inexact associations with clinical chemotherapy exposure. 

\subsection*{Pre-treatment neoantigens and CD8+ T cell infiltrate independently predict survival}

% STATEMENT_TREATMENT_EFFECT
Across the cohort, we identified 17,689 mutated peptides predicted to bind autologous MHC class I with affinity 500nm or tighter~\cite{Sette1994}. All but 21 (0.12\%) of these predicted neoantigens were private to a single patient (shared neoantigens are listed in Additional File 6).

% To contextualize the potential impact of changes in neoantigen burden associated with time point and chemotherapy, we first asked whether neoantigens correlated with patient survival or CD8+ T cell infiltration estimated from RNA-seq.

%To explore potential effects of changes in neoantigen burden,

% We investigated relationships among neoantigens, immune infiltrate from RNA-seq, and patient survival.

% Patients with greater predicted neoantigen burden in their solid tissue primary/untreated samples had longer survival (Figure~S8). In a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, patients with higher neoantigen count trended toward longer survival time (hazard ratio (HR) of mean/variance standardized neoantigen count: 0.77 (95\% CI 0.57--1.02), p=0.07). Expressed neoantigen burden showed a similar protective trend (HR=0.78 (0.59--1.03), p=0.08), in contrast to whole-genome mutation burden (HR=1.0 (0.69--1.44), p=0.9). The latter result is strongly affected by sample AOCS-166-1-2, from a patient with a germline deficiency in mismatch repair, by far the most mutations (66\% more than any other), and one of the shortest survival times (195 days). With this sample excluded, neoantigen count (HR=0.73 (0.54--0.97), p=0.03) and expressed neoantigen count (HR=0.75 (0.56--0.99), p=0.04) were significantly associated with survival, whereas mutation burden exhibited a weaker trend (HR=0.85 (0.65--1.11), p=0.2).

Patients with greater predicted neoantigen burden in their solid tissue primary/untreated samples had longer survival (Figure~S6). In a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, neoantigen count (hazard ratio (HR) of mean/variance standardized count: 0.73 (95\% CI 0.54--0.97), p=0.03) and expressed neoantigen count (HR=0.75 (0.56--0.99), p=0.04) were significantly associated with survival, whereas mutation burden exhibited a weaker trend (HR=0.85 (0.65--1.11), p=0.2). This analysis excludes sample AOCS-166-1-2, from a patient with a germline deficiency in mismatch repair and by far the most mutations. If this sample is included in the analysis, the estimated effects of neoantigen count (HR=0.77 (0.57--1.02), p=0.07) and expressed neoantigen count (HR=0.78 (0.59--1.03), p=0.08) are relatively unaffected, but mutation burden is skewed (HR=1.0 (0.69--1.44), p=0.9).

Immune infiltrate deconvolution of each sample's RNA-seq was performed using CIBERSORT, which estimates the relative abundance of 22 immune cell types as a fraction of the total immune infiltrate (Figures S7 and S8). One sample (AOCS-056-1-X) failed deconvolution and was excluded from these analyses. Samples taken before or after chemotherapy treatment were broadly similar in immune infiltrate. Nonactivated macrophages (M0 macrophages) were the most prevalent population in both solid tissue (median 22\% of infiltrate (range 0--54\%)) and ascites (26\% (3--57)) samples. Other myeloid lineage cells were also prevalent in ascites, including activated mast cells (9\% (0--69)) and monocytes (6\% (0--50)). Follicular helper (solid tissue: 10\% (0--23); ascites: 5\% (1--24)) and memory resting (9\% (0--31); 6\% (0--28)) CD4+ T cells were the most abundant lymphocyte populations in both stolid tissue and ascites samples.

%Alternatively activated macrophages (M2 macrophages) were prevalent in solid tissue (9\% (0--44)) and though less abundant in most ascites samples (1\% (0--46)) were more common than classically activated macrophages (M1 macrophages; 0.04\% (0--18)).

CD8+ T cells accounted for a median of 3\% (0--30) of infiltrate in solid tissue samples and were uniformly rare in ascites (0\% (0--3)). In primary/untreated solid tissue samples, greater CD8+ T cell infiltrate was associated with improved survival (HR=0.65 (0.47--0.88), p=0.006; Figure~S6). This appeared to be an independent effect from neoantigen burden. No significant correlation was observed between neoantigens and CD8+ T cell infiltrate, although among ascites samples increased total mutational burden was narrowly associated with increased CD8+ T cell infiltrate (p=0.03, Figure~S9). Both CD8+ T cell infiltrate and neoantigen burden were independently associated with survival in a Cox multiple regression analysis (CD8 T cells: HR=0.61 (0.44--0.85), p=0.003; neoantigens: HR=0.72 (0.54--0.97), p=0.03).

Among relapse/treated ascites samples, no significant survival association was observed for mutations (HR=1.2 (0.73--2.1), p=0.43), neoantigens (HR=0.81 (0.47--1.4), p=0.44), expressed neoantigens (HR=0.67 (0.387--1.15), p=0.14), or CD8+ T cells infiltrate (HR=1.2 (0.741--1.99), p=0.44). In a search over all immune cell subsets, no subset showed significant association after correction for multiple hypothesis testing.

%Activated mast cells showed a nominally significant association, with higher infiltrate associated with poor survival (HR=1.9 (1.09--3.26), uncorrected p=0.02, Bonferroni corrected p=0.82).

\subsection*{Neoantigen burden increases at relapse}

Relapse/treated samples harbored a median 78\% more expressed neoantigens than primary/untreated samples (weighted mean of stratum-specific estimates). Specifically, solid tissue relapse samples harbored a median of 71\% (bootstrap 95\% CI 23--123) more mutations, 107\% (32--187) more neoantigens, and 72\% (16--137) more expressed neoantigens than primary/untreated solid tissue samples (Figure~2), all significant increases (Mann-Whitney $p < 0.05$ for each of the three tests). A similar trend was observed for ascites samples. Relapse/treated ascites samples harbored 32\% (14--51), 55\% (10--118), and 83\% (22--178) more mutations, neoantigens, and expressed neoantigens than primary/untreated ascites samples, respectively ($p=0.07, 0.10, 0.05$ for the three tests). This trend was also apparent in a comparison of paired samples from the same donors (Figure~S10).

In contrast, primary/treated samples, which were exposed to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to surgery, did not exhibit increased numbers of mutations, neoantigens, or expressed neoantigens, and in fact trended toward decreased expressed neoantigen burden. The five primary/treated samples, all from solid tissue resections, harbored a median of 16 (9--89) expressed neoantigens compared to the median of 44 (39--60) observed in primary/untreated solid tissue samples, due to both fewer neoantigens in the DNA (median of 85 (36--306) vs. 130 (108--150)) and a lower rate of expression (median 19 (14--37) vs. 39 (36--42) percent of neoantigens). This trend did not reach significance (Mann-Whitney $p=0.08$), and will require larger cohorts to assess.

\subsection*{Chemotherapy signatures weakly contribute to neoantigen burden at relapse}

%We next performed signature deconvolution on the mutations detected in each sample (Figure~\ref{fig:supp_signatures} top and middle).

While we cannot determine with certainty whether any particular mutation was chemotherapy-induced, we can estimate the fraction of mutations and neoantigens attributable to each signature in a sample (Figures~3 and S11).

Similarly to results reported by Patch et al., the most prevalent mutational signatures in this cohort were COSMIC \textit{Signature (3)}, associated with BRCA disruption, \textit{Signature (8)}, of unknown etiology, and \textit{Signature (1)}, associated with spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine, a slow process active in healthy tissue that correlates with age (Figure~S3 top and middle). These signatures together accounted for a median of 67\% (95\% CI 66--69) of mutations, 58\% (56--61) of neoantigens, and 68\% (67--71) expressed neoantigens across samples. These rates did not substantially differ with chemotherapy treatment.

The chemotherapy signatures accounted for a small but detectable part of the increased neoantigen burden of relapse samples. In primary/untreated samples, which indicate the background rate of chance attribution, chemotherapy mutational signatures accounted for a mean of 2\% of the mutations (range 0--8), 2\% (0--7) of the neoantigens, and 2\% (0--8) of the expressed neoantigens. In each of the five primary/treated samples, less than 1\% of the mutation, neoantigen, and expressed neoantigen burdens were attributed to chemotherapy signatures. For the relapse/treated samples, chemotherapy signatures accounted for a mean of 6\% (range 0--21) of the mutations, 5\% (0--15) of the neoantigens, and 5\% (0--16) of the expressed neoantigens. The highest attribution to chemotherapy signatures occurred in sample AOCS-092-3-3, a relapse/treated sample from a patient who received two lines of carboplatin and three lines of cisplatin, the most in the cohort. For this sample, 21\% (or approximately 3,200 of 15,491) of the SNVs, 15\% (9 of 61) of the neoantigens, and 16\% (5 of 30) of the expressed neoantigens were attributed to chemotherapy signatures.

Signature deconvolution considers only SNVs, but studies of platinum-induced mutations have also reported increases in the rate of dinucleotide variants and indels. Indeed, we observed more MNVs overall and specifically the platinum-associated MNVs $CT \rightarrow AC$ and $CA \rightarrow AC$ reported by Meier et al.~\cite{Meier_2014} in treated patients in both absolute count and as a fraction of mutational burden ($p < 10^{-6}$ for all tests). Sample AOCS-092-3-3, previously found to have the most chemotherapy-signature SNVs, also had the most platinum-associated dinucleotide variants and the second-most MNVs overall. This sample harbored 59 $CT \rightarrow AC$ or $CA \rightarrow AC$ mutations, compared to a mean of 3.2 (2.2--4.4) across all samples. Treated samples also harbored more indels in terms of absolute count ($p=10^{-4}$). Overall, while MNVs and indels generate more neoantigens per mutation than SNVs, they are rare, comprising less than 3\% of the mutational burden and 13\% of the neantigens in every sample (Figure~3), making it unlikely that chemotherapy-induced MNVs and indels have a large impact on neoantigen burden.


\section*{Discussion}
In this analysis of neoantigens predicted from DNA and RNA sequencing of ovarian cancer tumor and ascites samples, relapse samples obtained after chemotherapy exposure had a median of 78\% more expressed neoantigens than untreated primary samples. However, putative chemotherapy mutational signatures accounted for no more than 16\% of the expressed neoantigen burden in any sample. Most of the increase was instead attributable to mutagenic processes already at work in the primary samples, including COSMIC \textit{Signature (3) BRCA} and \textit{Signature (8) Unknown etiology}. 

It is likely that many of the mutations considered unique to the relapse/treated samples were actually present before treatment, but were confined to too few cells to be detected. After surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, outgrowth of a subclone would bring such private mutations to population levels detectable by bulk sequencing in the relapse/treated samples. Consistent with this interpretation, NACT-treated samples, which were exposed to chemotherapy as large tumors and for a short duration (typically 3 cycles), did not show increased mutation or neoantigen burden over untreated samples and had very few mutations attributed to chemotherapy.

Our results suggest it would be difficult to rationally increase neoantigen burden through chemotherapy, as even the most heavily treated patients show only a modest number chemotherapy-associated neoantigens. The patient with the most such neoantigens, AOCS-092, had 9/61 neoantigens attributed to chemotherapy. Applying the previously fit Cox proportional hazards model, 9 additional neoantigens are predicted to improve two year survival rate by only 1.1 percentage points (from 43.7\% to 44.8\%). Moreover, as immunotherapy trials in heavily pre-treated recurrent HGSC have failed to achieve durable responses, the substantially increased total neoantigen burden at recurrence is evidently not sufficient on its own for immunotherapy to be effective~\cite{Drerup2015}. Other factors, perhaps unique ascitic or systemic immunosuppressive mechanisms, likely must be overcome for immunotherapy to be effective in this disease.

%While neoantigens are one factor among others contributing to tumor immunity, their

%The relevance of neoantigens in HGSC, however, is highlighted by the observation that

Remarkably, in primary/untreated samples, neoantigen burden was more closely associated with survival than overall mutation burden. This did not appear to be mediated by concomitant CD8+ T cell infiltration in the primary tumor; both factors independently associated with survival. Previous reports that have found neoantigens and CD8+ T cell infiltrate to be favorable prognostic markers in a variety of tumor types and clinical contexts~\cite{Sato2005,Hamanishi2007,Pages2010,Brown_2014,Mlecnik2016}. Analyses of both factors, however, have generally found a positive association between neoantigen burden and markers of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes~\cite{Rooney_2015,Giannakis2016}. Our smaller sample size may explain the lack of significant association. Alternatively, some samples with low neoantigen burden and high immune infiltration may have experienced selective loss of neoantigens, a process termed immunoediting~\cite{Dunn2002}. One study reported a depletion of neoantigens, relative to what would be expected from the silent mutation rate, in several cancer types, but no significant effect in ovarian cancer samples with whole exome sequencing deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas~\cite{Rooney_2015}. The present dataset would be an interesting cohort to further probe such an effect.

% In one report, a depletion of predicted neoantigens, relative to what would be expected from the silent mutation rate, was observed in colorectal, kidney clear cell, and several other cancers, but not in whole-exome sequenced ovarian cancer samples with whole exome sequencing deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas~\cite{Rooney_2015}. The present dataset, with fewer samples but the advantage of whole genome sequencing, may be an interesting basis for such investigation. 

%as tumor samples are a snapshot of a dynamically evolving equilibrium, in which increased neoantigens may pull in T cells, which, through a process termed immunoediting~\cite{Dunn2002}, select for a loss of neoantigens, samples with low neoantigen burden and high immune infiltration may have experienced selective loss of neoantigens. 

%An increase in indels and cisplatin-associated dinucleotide variants was observed in relapse/treated samples, but these variants were relatively rare and resulted in less than 13\% of the predicted neoantigen burden in every sample.

% These results are consistent with a model in which outgrowth of a subclone following surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy brings many mutations previously confined to a small number of cells to population levels detectable by bulk sequencing. Consistent with this interpretation, NACT-treated samples, which were exposed to chemotherapy as large tumors and for a short duration (typically 3 cycles), did not show increased mutation or neoantigen burden over untreated samples and had very few mutations attributed to chemotherapy.

% In such a model, it is not the direct mutagenic effect of the treatment that increases the mutational burden, but rather the indirect effect of creating a population bottleneck. 

%Other factors, perhaps unique immunosuppressive mechanisms, likely need to be overcome for immunotherapy to be effective in this disease.


%  To speculate, in HGSC high neoantigen load, even in the absence of immune infiltration in the primary tumor, may still protect against disease spread in the peritenoeal cavaity, whereas high levels of infiltrating immune cells may disrupt the primary tumor even if the neoantigen burden is modest.

%One possible reason these factors may appear independent is that in HGSC neoantigen burden, even in the absence of immune infiltration in the primary tumor, may still protect against disease spread beyond the tumor. Tumor samples are a snapshot of a dynamically evolving equilibrium, in which increased neoantigens may pull in T cells, which, through a process termed immunoediting, select for a loss of neoantigens. A further potential reason 

% Other reports across tumor types have associated increased neoantigen burden with greater T cell infiltration. Tumor samples are a snapshot of a dynamically evolving equilibrium, in which increased neoantigens may pull in T cells, which, through a process termed immunoediting, select for a loss of neoantigens. It is not unexpected that 

% It was interesting to observe that neoantigen burden in the primary/untreated samples was a stronger predictor of patient survival than overall mutaiton burden, and that neoantigen burden and CD8+ T cell infiltrate estimated by CIBERSORT were both independent predictors of survival. Several studies have reported the importance of CD8+ T cell infiltrate as a prognostic marker in HGSC~\cite{Sato2005,Hamanishi2007}; the role of neoantigens over total mutation burden has been reported in the context of immunotherapy~\cite{Van_Allen_2015,Rizvi_2015} and for patients treated with conventional chemotherapies as in our case~\cite{Brown_2014}. Studies of larger cohorts have reported relationships between neoantigen burden and markers of T cell infiltration~\cite{Rooney_2015,Giannakis2016}; the absence of a correlation in our data may be due to our smaller cohort.

 %[...]. Finally, our cohort of X ascites samples for whcih immune decovnoltuion ahs been performed is generally in agreement with the importance of myelooid cells (especially IL-10 secereting M2 (?) macrophages) in this disease.


%As most immunotherapy trials to date in ovarian cancer have been in the setting of heavily pre-treated patients, the increase in neoantigens after primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is demonstrably not sufficient to render immunotherapy effective. Other factors besides neoantigen burden, for example the unique immunosuppressive environment of ascites, are likely involved [ref].

% The clinical implications of such a picture are that it would be difficult to rationally increase the neoantigen burden by manipulating chemotherapy dosage, but patients who suffer relapses or recurrences after primary debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy may be expected to harbor significantly more potential neoantigens. 

% This is likely because individual chemotherapy-induced mutations remain confined to subclones too rare for detection by bulk sequencing in the absence of the population bottleneck created by surgery and/or the multiple lines of chemotherapy provided in the adjuvant setting.

% Our results are in contrast to a study of NACT temozlomide-treated glioma, in which it was reported that over 98\% of mutations detectable with bulk sequencing in some samples were attributable to temozolomide~\cite{Johnson_2013}. Whether this difference is due to the drug used or disease biology requires further study.

% This data suggests that mutagenesis from chemotherapy is likely not a dominant factor in this effect. 

The signatures for cisplatin and, to a lesser extent, cyclophosphamide extracted from the \textit{G. Gallus} experiments showed some correlation with clinical treatment, whereas the \textit{G. Gallus} etoposide and \textit{C. Elegans} cisplatin signatures were not detected in chemotherapy-exposed samples. The latter signature may be less accurate than the \textit{G. Gallus} cisplatin signature because it was derived from fewer mutations (784 vs. 2633).  The number of mutations attributed to the \textit{G. Gallus} cisplatin signature correlated with the number of cycles of platinum chemotherapy; a weak trend held among patients treated only with carboplatin. In the case of cyclophosphamide, deconvolution of all mutations identified the signature in 4/10 samples treated with cyclophosphamide and 4/104 unexposed samples. However, when we focused on mutations detected uniquely in the post-treatment samples, 6/8 samples exposed only to non-cyclophosphamide chemotherapies exhibited the signature. As it was rarely detected in pre-treatment samples, this signature may reflect the effect of other chemotherapy.

% Many treated samples showed no chemotherapy signatures at the 6\% detection threshold; when chemotherapy signatures were detected, they were found at levels close to the 6\% detection threshold.

% Analysis of the paired pre- and post-treatment samples indicated that the \textit{G. Gallus} cisplatin signature was specific for cisplatin rather than carboplatin exposure, suggesting that carboplatin may induce fewer mutations or mutations with a different signature than cisplatin.  

% Etoposide-induced mutations may be difficult to detect because in the \textit{G. Gallus} experiments they occurred at a more uniform distribution of mutational contexts and at a much lower overall rate than mutations induced by cisplatin or cyclophosphamide. Importantly, only one patient in this cohort received etoposide.

% Etoposide-induced mutations may be difficult to detect because in the \textit{G. Gallus} experiments they occurred at a more uniform distribution of mutational contexts and at a much lower overall rate than mutations induced by cisplatin or cyclophosphamide.

% The association between signatures and clinical exposures give some confidence that our analysis captures the effect of chemotherapy, but,


% Alternatively, \textit{de novo} identification of chemotherapy signatures from clinical samples may become feasible as more post-treatment samples are sequenced. Tumor types other than HGSC may more readily show detectable levels of chemotherapy-induced mutations to inform such a deconvolution. 

% We note, however, that the signatures dominant in the primary/untreated samples --- COSMIC Signatures (1), (3), and (8) --- also account for most of the SNVs in the relapse/treated samples. Therefore, irrespective of the accuracy of the chemotherapy signatures, it appears that most mutations in relapse samples are due to mutagenic processes already operative prior to therapy.

% A striking example is a study of NACT temozlomide-treated glioma, in which it was reported that over 98\% of mutations detectable with bulk sequencing in some samples were attributable to temozolomide~\cite{Johnson_2013}. Whether the difference between the current study and this is due to the drug used or disease biology requires further study.

% It appears unlikely that chemotherapy-induced mutations would happen to match the same signatures operative prior to treatment.

%Relapse/treated samples had a median of 26\% (95\% CI 23--27) of their SNVs attributed to other signatures, compared to 29\% (26--30) for primary/untreated samples.

% If this were a significant effect, however, we would expect to see more mutations attributed to signatures other than chemotherapy and those active in the primaries (COSMIC Signatures 1, 3, and 8) in the relapse/treated samples. We do not see such an increase (see ``Other SNV'' in Figure~\ref{fig:sources}). 



% The observation that the NACT samples trended toward fewer expressed neoantigens raises the possibility of immunoediting after chemotherapy~\cite{Dunn_2002}, consistent with suggestions that paclitaxel/carboplatin and other chemotherapies may enhance T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity in solid tumors~\cite{Demaria2001,Wu_2009,Pfannenstiel_2010,Hodge_2013}. However, this observation is based on only five samples, none of which were paired with a pre-treatment sample, and our analysis method (hard thresholds on the count of RNA reads at variant positions) is sensitive to changes in expression of unrelated genes. Larger cohorts of matched biopsies and post-NACT tumor samples are likely required to investigate this question.

% Such subclonal neoantigens may be unable to support an effective anti-tumor immune response~\cite{McGranahan_2016}.

% STATEMENT_MEDIAN_NEOANTIGENS

A contrast to our results is a report of NACT temozlomide-treated glioma, in which it was reported that over 98\% of mutations detectable with bulk sequencing in some samples were attributable to temozolomide~\cite{Johnson_2013}. Whether this difference is due to the drug used or disease biology requires further study.

We predicted a median of 64 (50--75) expressed MHC I neoantigens across all samples in the cohort, significantly more than the median of 6 reported by Martin et al. in this disease~\cite{Martin_2016}. However, Martin et al. did not consider indels, MNVs, or multiple neoantigens that can result from the same missense mutation, used a 100nm instead of 500nm MHC I binding threshold, used predominantly lower quality (50bp) sequencing, and only explicitly considered HLA-A alleles. Predicted neoantigen burden is best considered a relative measure of tumor foreignness, not an absolute quantity readily comparable across studies.

This study has several important limitations. Most critically, as the signatures may differ from actual effects in patients, chemotherapy-induced mutations could erroneously be attributed to non-chemotherapy signatures. This would result in an underestimation of the impact of chemotherapy. However, the fraction of mutations that do not match COSMIC signatures (1), (3), or (8) or a chemotherapy signature, a quantity indicated as ``Other SNV'' in Figure~3, is no greater in the treated vs. untreated samples. This is evidence against a scenario in which many chemotherapy-induced mutations are unaccounted for in our analysis because they do not match any signature or spuriously match other COSMIC signatures. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that chemotherapy-induced mutations could be erroneously attributed to COSMIC Signatures (1), (3), or (8). Experiments using human cell lines exposed to the range of chemotherapies used in recurrent ovarian cancer may be needed to fully address this question.

As this study is based on bulk DNA sequencing of heterogeneous clinical samples, the analysis is limited to neoantigens arising from mutations that are present in at least 5-10\% of the cells in a sample. Data from Patch et al. suggests that even late-stage disease remains polyclonal, therefore potentially obscuring the impact of chemotherapy on the tumor genome. Single-cell sequencing may be required to observe most chemotherapy-induced mutations, especially in the neoadjuvant setting. However, while we may have been unable to detect highly subclonal mutations, it is expected that such clones would be unable to trigger an anti-tumor immune response that is effective against the bulk of the tumor~\cite{McGranahan_2016}. 

Finally, this study does not consider neoantigens resulting from structural rearrangements such as gene fusions and relies on only 35 post-chemotherapy samples.

% As previously mentioned, the possibility that chemotherapy-induced mutations are spuriously attributed to mutational signatures already operative in the primary tissue cannot formally be excluded. 

\section*{Conclusion}
In this study, we demonstrate a method for connecting mutational signatures extracted from studies of mutagen exposure in preclinical models with computationally predicted neoantigen burden in clinical samples. We found that relapsed HGSC tumors harbor a median of 78\% more expressed neoantigens than untreated primary samples, and that cisplatin and cyclophophamide chemotherapy treatments account for a small but detectable part of this effect. The mutagenic processes responsible for most mutations at relapse are similar to those operative in primary tumors, with COSMIC \textit{Signature (3) BRCA}, \textit{Signature (1) Age}, and \textit{Signature (8) Unknown etiology} accounting for most mutations and predicted neoantigens both before and after chemotherapy.
