Change in neoantigens: is it important, how does total count compare to TCGA

The fraction of cancer cells harboring a neoantigen may be critical in its ability to be targeted by a T cell response \cite{McGranahan_2016}.

The loss of expressed neoantigens in the solid tumors is interesting. Consistent with increased immune surveillence.

Chemo may be immunogenic, which may be a more important factor than neoantigens


There are several limitations... RNA with hard thresholds to detect expressed peptides is subject to confounding by changes in gene expression -- e.g. if something gets upregulated post treatment
