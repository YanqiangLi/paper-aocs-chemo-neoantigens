\section*{Conclusion}
While relapsed high grade serous ovarian cancer tumors are predicted to harbor nearly double the expressed neoantigen burden of primary samples, adjuvant cisplatin and cyclophophamide chemotherapy treatments account for a small but detectable fraction of the increase. Other mutagenic processes, including COSMIC \textit{Signature 3}, associated with BRCA disruption, and \textit{Signature 8}, of unknown etiology, account for most of the mutations and neoantigens both before and after chemotherapy.
