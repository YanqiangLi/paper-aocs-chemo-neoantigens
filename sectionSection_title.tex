\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Somatic mutation and neoantigen burden}

As previously reported for the AOCS patients, there were significantly more detectable somatic mutations in the relapse samples over matched primary samples (increase in 15/16 sample pairs; binomial test $p \lt 0.001$). The change ranged from -17\% to 134\% with a mean of 27\%.

We considered the number of mutations resulting in peptides predicted to bind autologous class I MHC with 500nm or stronger affinity (figure \ref{fig:mhc_binding_mutations}). In accordance with the increase in overall mutation burden, we observed an upward trend in potential neoantigens at recurrence. For 10/14 patients, relapse samples harbored more potential neoantigens than matched primary samples; however this trend did not reach significance (p=0.18). The change ranged from -27\% to 126\% with a mean of 29\%. About half of these mutations had evidence for expression in the RNA-seq. For 9/13 donors the number of expressed potentially antigenic mutations increased at relapse (-53\% -- 407\%, mean 18\%) (p=0.27) (figure \ref{fig:expressed_mhc_binding_mutations}). We found no evidence for selection against expressed potential neoantigens at relapse (data not shown).

\subsection*{Clonality}
The new mutations undetected in the primary samples tended to be found at lower variant allele frequency (VAF) in the relapse samples than shared mutations (Mann-Whitney $p \lt .01$ in 14/16 samples), indicating the new mutations tended to be more subclonal. However, the size of this effect was relatively small. On average the mutations private to the relapse sample were found at 82\% (bootstrap 95\% CI=72-93) of the VAF of shared mutations. This effect was smaller still for mutations predicted to bind MHC I, for which new mutations were found at 89\% (72-107) of the VAF of shared mutations.

\subsection*{Mutational signatures}
To explore possible etiologies for the increased mutational burden at recurrence, we deconvolved the mutations present in the primaries as well as the unique-to-recurrence mutations into known signatures. We used the 30 signatures curated by COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures) plus an additional signature extracted from a study of C. Elegans after cisplatin exposure [Meier et al]. Consistent with results originally reported by Patch et al on this data, the mutations present in the primary tumors were attributable mostly to Signatures 1 and 3, which are associated with Age and BRCA disruption, respectively. We deconvolved the mutations unique to the recurrence samples. 

We note that the C(C>T)C mutations found at higher rates in the relapse samples do not correspond to the signature found in \textit{C. Elegans} (supplementary figure).
