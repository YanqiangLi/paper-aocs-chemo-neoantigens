% The treated samples showed more mutations, neoantigens, and, in the case of ascites samples, more expressed neoantigens (Table~\ref{tab:cohort}).

% STATEMENT_TREATMENT_EFFECT
We identified 17,689 mutated peptides predicted to bind autologous MHC class I with affinity 500nm or tighter ~\cite{Sette1994}, which we refer to as neoantigens. All but 21 (0.12\%) neoantigens were private to a single patient.

Solid tissue samples taken after adjuvant chemotherapy and disease recurrence harbored more mutations, neoantigens, and expressed neoantigens than chemotherapy-naive primary solid tissue samples (two-sided Mann-Whitney $p < 0.004$ for all tests, Figure~\ref{fig:counts}). Similar trends were observed for ascites samples ($p = 0.08, 0.11, 0.04$ for increases in mutation, neoantigen, and expressed neoantigen load, respectively), and in a pairwise comparison of samples from the same donors (Figure~\ref{fig:supp_paired}).

In contrast, neoadjuvant-treated primary samples, which may better isolate any effect of chemotherapy because disease recurrence is not a factor, did not exhibit an increase in mutations, neoantigens, or expressed neoantigens, and in fact trended toward decreased expressed neoantigen burden. Neoadjuvant-treated samples of solid tissue harbored a median of 16 expressed neoantigens compared to the median of 44 observed in chemotherapy naive samples, a difference attributable to both fewer neoantigens in the DNA (median of 85 vs. 130) and a lower rate of expression (median 19 vs. 39 percent of neoantigens). However, this difference did not reach significance (Mann-Whitney $p=0.09$), and will require larger cohorts to definitely assess.

We first performed signature deconvolution on the full set of mutations present in each sample (Figure~\ref{fig:supp_signatures} top and middle). Similar to results originally reported by Patch et al, the most prevalent mutational signatures in this cohort were COSMIC \textit{Signature 3}, associated with BRCA disruption, \textit{Signature 8}, of unknown etiology, and \textit{Signature 1}, associated with a slow mutagenic process active in healthy tissue. These signatures together accounted for a mean of 65\% (95\% CI from bootstrap across samples: 63 - 67) of mutations and 58\% (56 - 59) of neoantigens across samples.

The authors of the deconstructSigs signature deconvolution package reported that signatures accounting for at least 6\% of the mutations in a sample had good concordance with validation data, but that signatures below this threshold were often false positives. Presence of the cyclophosphamide signature at this threshold was associated with a clinical record of cyclophosphamide treatment (Fischer's exact test $p = 0.001$), occurring in 4/104 non-cyclophosphamide treated samples and 4/10 samples taken after cyclophosphamide treatment. In contrast, the two cisplatin signatures were found in no samples, and the etoposide signature was found only in four pre-treatment samples. Etoposide-induced mutations may be resistant to detection using signature deconvolution because, as reported in Szikriszt et al, this drug induces mutations at a nearly uniform rate across mutational contexts. 

% STATEMENT_UNIQUE_TO_TREATED_COUNT

For better sensitivity, we next focused on the 14 samples from 12 patients with paired pre- and post-treatment samples. For each patient, we extracted the mutations that had evidence exclusively in the treated samples, requiring more than 30 reads coverage and zero variant reads in the pre-treatment samples. Of 206,766 SNVs in the post-treatment samples for these patients, 93,986 (45\%) satisfied this filter and were subjected to signature deconvolution (Figure ~\ref{fig:signatures}). Within this subgroup, the \textit{G. gallus} cisplatin signature was associated with cisplatin exposure ($p = 0.01$), as it was identified only in the two samples taken after cisplatin therapy. The \texitit{C. Elegans} cisplatin signature was detected in no samples, and the cyclophosphamide signature was detected in 3/6 cyc-treated samples but, surprisingly, 6/8 non-cyc-treated samples. The COSMIC signatures \textit{3} (BRCA disruption) and \textit{8} (unknown etiology) were detected in 14/14 and 9/14 post-treatment samples, respectively, but \textit{Signature 1} (Age) was completely absent, consistent with its association with a slow mutagenic process operative before oncogenesis.

We estimated the number of mutations and neoantigens attributable to each signature (Figures~\ref{fig:sources} and~\ref{fig:supp_sources}). In an effort to avoid underestimating chemotherapy-induced neoantigens, we considered all signatures found at any fraction, even less than the recommended 6\% threshole. Sample AOCS-092-3-3, a post-treatment sample from a patient who received eight distinct chemotherapeutic agents, the most of any sample in the cohort, showed the greatest contribution from chemotherapy SNV signatures, with 21\% of mutations and 15\% of neoantigens attributed to a chemotherapy-associated signature. The other post-treatment samples showed less than 14\% of mutations and 11\% of neoantigens attributed to chemotherapy-associated SNVs.

Signature deconvolution considers only SNVs, but studies of platinum mutagenesis have also reported increases in the rate of dinucleotide variants and indels. Indeed, we observed more multinucleotide variants (MNVs) overall and specifically the platinum-associated MNVs $CT \rightarrow AC$ and $CA \rightarrow AC$ reported by Meier et al~\cite{Meier_2014} in treated patients in terms of both absolute counts and as a fraction of overall mutational burden (Mann-Whitney $p < 10^{-6}$ for all tests). Sample AOCS-092-3-3, previously found to have the most chemotherapy-signature SNVs, also had the most platinum-associated dinucleotide variants and the third-most MNVs overall. This sample harbored 59 $CT \rightarrow AC$ or $CA \rightarrow AC$ mutations, compared to a mean of 3.2 (95\% CI 2.2--4.4) across all samples. Treated samples also harbored more indels in terms of absolute count ($p=10^{-4}$). Overall, while MNVs and indels generate more neoantigens per mutation than SNVs, they are rare, comprising less than 2.5\% of the mutational burden and 13\% of the neantigens in all samples in this cohort (Figure~\ref{fig:sources}), making it unlikely that chemotherapy-induced MNVs and indels have a large impact on neoantigen burden.

% Treated samples harbored a mean of 153 (bootstrap 95\% CI 130--180) MNVs, compared to 62 (56--59) in pre-treatment samples, and specifically showed an increase in the $CT \rightarrow AC$ and $CA \rightarrow AC$ reported by Meier et al~\cite{Meier_2014}

It was recently reported that high variant-allele frequency (i.e. clonal) neoantigens may be required to elicit a cytotoxic T cell response~\cite{McGranahan_2016}. As expected, in the treated samples, SNVs likely to be chemotherapy-associated were found at lower variant allele frequencies than other SNVs ($p < 10^{-10}$). Chemotherapy-associated SNVs had on average 11\% (6--17) lower variant allele frequency than other SNVs and were approximately half as likely to be found in the top decile of variant allele frequency.

%Several chemotherapy signatures were detected at a 5\% detection threshold in post-treatment samples, but some were also detected in pre-treatment samples, indicating a substantial false-positive rate. The \textit{C. Elegans} cisplatin \textit{xpf-1} and \textit{fcd-2} knockout signatures were detected in 2/35 and 1/35 post-treatment samples, respectively, and no pre-treatment samples, providing relatively weak evidence that they may be associated with treatment (two-sided Fischer's exact test $p=0.03$). The cyclophosphamide signature was found in 4/80 pre-treatment and 9/35 post-treatment samples ($p=0.003$). However, 5/9 of the post-treatment samples with detection had no clinical record of cyclophosphamide use. The cisplatin \textit{polq-1} knockout signature was similarly found in 3/80 pre-treatment and 6/35 post-treatment samples ($p=0.02$). Other chemotherapy signatures were either not detected in any samples (cisplatin \textit{G. Gallus} signature, other cisplatin \textit{C. Elegans} signatures) or had a high detection rate in the pre-treatment samples (etoposide signature, found in 9/80 pre-treatment samples). The only COSMIC signature with a known chemotherapy association, \textit{Signature 11}, associated with alkylating agents, was not detected in any samples.

%For better sensitivity, we next focused on the 14 samples from 12 patients with paired pre- and post-treatment samples. For each patient, we extracted the mutations that had evidence exclusively in the treated samples, requiring at least 30 reads coverage and zero variant reads in the pre-treatment samples. Of 222,709 SNV mutations in the post-treatment samples for these patients, 102,377 (46\%) matched this filter and were subjected to signature deconvolution (Figure ~\ref{fig:signatures}). The \textit{G. gallus} cisplatin signature, previously undetected in all samples, was found in the two cisplatin-treated samples present in this analysis (DB: meaning unclear), suggesting it may be a marker of cisplatin, but not carboplatin, exposure (DB: meaning unclear). The \textit{C. Elegans} \textit{fcd-2} knockout was detected in four samples, all having received carboplatin but not cisplatin. COSMIC signatures \textit{3} (BRCA disruption) and \textit{8} (unknown etiology) were detected in 14/14 and 9/14 post-treatment samples, respectively, but \textit{Signature 1} (Age) was completely absent, consistent with its association with a slow mutagenic process operative before oncogenesis.

% STATEMENT_NEOANTIGENS1
% Using sequence-based HLA typing and computational pMHC binding prediction, we identified 18,336 mutated peptides predicted to bind autologous MHC class I with affinity 500nm or tighter ~\cite{Sette1994}, which we refer to as neoantigens. For samples with RNA sequencing, we also counted ``expressed neoantigens,'' defined as neoantigens resulting from mutations with three or more RNA reads supporting the alternate allele. All but 26 (0.14\%) neoantigens were private to a single patient.

%Neoantigens tracked the increase in mutational burden after chemotherapy. In the Bayesian analysis, treated samples had 65\% (95\% credible interval -14--174) more neoantigens, and, for ascites samples, 117\% (3--286) more expressed neoantigens. Interestingly, solid tumor samples showed an increase in neoantigens but a 43\% (2--71) decrease in expressed neoantigens after treatment.
