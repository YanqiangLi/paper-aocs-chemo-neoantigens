\subsection*{Somatic mutation and neoantigen burden}

As expected somatic mutation and neoantigen burden were highly correlated with no substantial deviations

Therapy vs. burden


\subsection*{Mutational signatures}
To explore possible etiologies for the increased mutational burden at recurrence, we deconvolved the mutations present in the primaries as well as the unique-to-recurrence mutations into known signatures. We used the 30 signatures curated by COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures) plus an additional signature extracted from a study of C. Elegans after cisplatin exposure [Meier et al]. Consistent with results originally reported by Patch et al on this data, the mutations present in the primary tumors were attributable mostly to Signatures 1 and 3, which are associated with Age and BRCA disruption, respectively. We deconvolved the mutations unique to the recurrence samples. 

We note that the C(C>T)C mutations found at higher rates in the relapse samples do not correspond to the signature found in \textit{C. Elegans} (supplementary figure).
