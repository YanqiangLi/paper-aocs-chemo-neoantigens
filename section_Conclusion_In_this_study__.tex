\section*{Conclusion}
In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach for extracting mutational signatures from studies of mutagen-exposed animals, applying them to mutations identified in human cancer samples, and connecting the results to computationally predicted neoantigen burden. We found that relapsed high grade serous ovarian cancer tumors harbor nearly double the predicted expressed neoantigen burden of primary samples, and that adjuvant cisplatin and cyclophophamide chemotherapy treatments account for a small but detectable part of this effect. The mutagenic processes responsible for most mutations at relapse are remarkably consistent with those operative in primary tumors, with COSMIC \textit{Signature (3)}, associated with BRCA disruption, \textit{Signature (1)}, associated with spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine, and \textit{Signature (8)}, of unknown etiology, accounting for most of the mutations and neoantigens both before and after chemotherapy.
