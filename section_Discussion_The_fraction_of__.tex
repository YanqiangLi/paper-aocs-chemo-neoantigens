The fraction of cancer cells harboring a neoantigen may be critical in its ability to be targeted by a T cell response \cite{McGranahan_2016}.

 This suggests the increased burden at relapse in these Ovarian cancer samples is not predominantly due to direct mutagenic impact of the adjuvant chemotherapy, in contrast to a recent report for neo-adjuvant treated Esophageal cancer.
